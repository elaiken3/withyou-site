# With You — Landing Page

This repo hosts the public landing page for **WithYou**, an early TestFlight build designed to help ADHD brains get started, stay focused, and complete tasks without pressure or shame.

## What’s in this repo

- `index.html` — the landing page
- `styles.css` — lightweight styling (no framework)
- `assets/` — optional images (add later if needed)

## Local preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a tiny local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
